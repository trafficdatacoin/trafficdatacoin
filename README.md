After barely six months from genesis the original developers have completely abandoned this project, removing the GitHub source code and deleting the website, twitter, and discord. The community has taken over the development and direction of the project, repurposing the existing blockchain to allow for instant transactions, wallet balance staking, and masternode operations.
